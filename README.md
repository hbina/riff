# riff (HBINA's Fork)

## Crate for doing IO on RIFF-formatted files

This crate provides utility methods for reading and writing formats such as
Microsoft Wave, Audio Video Interleave or Downloadable Sounds.

### Examples

Please see the [tests](tests/integration_test.rs) to see how to use it.

## Note

This is a fork of the [original library](https://github.com/frabert/riff) with a completel overhaul of the internals.
I intend to publish this as a separate library.
